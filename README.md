# The working schedule

## The optimization of speed

- [ ] Insert checkpoints at different parts of the code
- [ ] Record the running time of different parts
- [ ] Search for better tools and packages for improving the speed

## The test of code stability

- [ ] Read relevant papers about the design of simulations
- [ ] Try simulation studies with some outliers and other factors that may not be numerical stable
- [ ] Once discovering errors, fix them

## Other methods incorperation

- [ ] Read relevant papers about other methods
- [ ] Design the simulation pipelines for comparing methods
- [ ] Design new methods and evaluate them with the simulation
